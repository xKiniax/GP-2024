# Games Programming - Assignment 1

"Musical Play & Experimentation" 

![](images/cybertrad.png.jpg)

For this individual assignment, you will create an interactive musical experience using Godot. You can choose to make:

1. A Musical Instrument/Toy
   - A virtual instrument that makes sounds when you interact with it
   - A musical toy that creates fun sounds and visuals
   - An interactive soundboard with visual feedback

2. A Music Game
   - A simple rhythm game where you match beats
   - A musical memory game
   - You can start by [forking this example](https://github.com/skooter500/duckies2.0)
   - Watch [this video from GodotCon for inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEZvcG_TIHo)

3. A Music Visualizer
   - Create visual effects that react to music
   - Make patterns and shapes move to sound
   - Create an interactive light show

## Technical Requirements
Your project must include:
- At least one scene with a clear user interface
- Multiple interactive elements (buttons, sliders, or clickable areas)
- Sound playback or generation
- Visual feedback when sounds play
- At least one loop (for example, repeating sounds or animations)
- At least one if statement (for example, checking if a button is pressed)
- Regular commits to git showing your progress

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding basic Godot concepts (nodes, scenes, signals)
- Writing simple GDScript code
- Creating user interfaces
- Working with audio in Godot
- Using version control (git)

## Project Ideas
Simple examples you could build on:
- A piano with colorful keys
- Animal sounds toybox for kids
- Simple beat maker with loops
- Shape-based music maker
- Musical memory game
- Audio-reactive particle system
- Drum kit with visual effects
- Sound effects board

## Rubric

| Category | Weighting | 1 | 2.1 | 2.2 | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Technical Implementation (40%) | Multiple different interactions (clicks, drags, holds). Uses loops effectively. At least one array. Multiple scenes. Timers for timing events. Good signal connections. Clean, commented code. Multiple scripts. Excellent error handling. Regular, meaningful git commits throughout development | Basic interaction with multiple controls. Simple loops. Single scene with good organization. Basic signal usage. Code works reliably. Some comments. Regular git commits | Simple button interactions. Basic sound playback. Working signals. Code needs some cleanup. Basic git usage | Minimal working code. Few interactions. Sparse git commits | Non-functional code. No version control |
| Creativity & Design (40%) | Original concept with engaging interaction. Professional-looking interface. Clear visual feedback. Multiple sound varieties. Coherent visual style. Original assets or well-integrated free assets. Smooth animations or transitions. Project feels polished and complete | Good original concept. Clear interface. Good visual feedback. Multiple sounds. Consistent style. Mix of original and free assets | Basic but complete concept. Simple interface. Basic feedback. Limited sound variety | Minimal design effort. Basic interface. Few sounds | Incomplete or non-functional |
| Documentation (20%) | Clear readme file explaining the project. Video demonstration showing all features. Screenshots in documentation. Setup instructions. Regular, well-spaced git commits | Good readme with main features documented. Video showing core features. Regular git commits | Basic readme. Simple video or screenshots. Some git commits | Minimal documentation. Few commits | No documentation or version control |

## Submission Requirements
1. Your Godot project in a git repository
2. Documentation including:
   - Project description
   - Instructions on how to use your project
   - List of features
   - Screenshots or video demonstration
3. In-class demonstration

Tips for Success:
- Start simple and add features gradually
- Commit your changes to git regularly
- Test your project frequently
- Ask for help if you get stuck
- Have fun experimenting!
